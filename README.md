-What the project does:
Restaurant Reviews is a user-created reviews website for a handful of restaurants in the northeast ohio area. The site lists selectable restaurants in an "index" page, with the user-created reviews in a separate "reviews" page, categorized by restaurant.

-Why the project is useful:
Restaurant Reviews lets the user view reviews for a restuarant left by other users, as well as create thier own reviews, or edit an existing review. Each Restaurant "details" page contains an image of the restaurant, and a short description.

-How users can get started with the project:
Once a user navigates to the site, they can choose a restaurant from the index. From there, they can choose to create, edit, delete a review, or read reviews left by other users. Each page contains a link near the bottom of the page that will navigate back to the main listing, where they can choose to view other restaurants.

-Where users can get help with your project:
If you encounter a bug while using the site, you can send an email with a description of the issue to dakotawhittle1203@gmail.com
